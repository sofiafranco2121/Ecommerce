# ðŸš€ AI-Powered Chatbot for eCommerce with RAG ðŸ¤–  

I recently built an **intelligent chatbot** for an online store using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and AI agents to provide accurate, context-aware responses about products and store policies.  

##  How It Works  
âœ… **Processes documents** â€“ Policies and terms are stored in a vector database for semantic search.  
âœ… **Retrieves product data** â€“ Pulls product names, descriptions, prices, and purchase links from **Google Sheets**.  
âœ… **Understands queries with RAG** â€“ Uses embeddings to improve query understanding and deliver relevant responses in real-time.  

ðŸ’¡ **Enhance the user experience with instant, accurate, and informative chatbot interactions!** ðŸš€
